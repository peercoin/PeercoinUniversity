# 1. Introduction

Peercoin was launched in 2012, making it one of the first blockchains to be released. It introduced a number of new innovations which substantially improved on the design of other blockchain protocols that existed at the time, principally Bitcoin’s proof-of-work. Peercoin’s alternative to proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, remains unrivaled to this day as a blockchain consensus protocol and one which is achieving more mainstream adoption with each passing year.

For the newcomer, understanding why Peercoin’s blockchain technology is superior first requires some understanding about blockchains in general, as well as understanding Peercoin’s primary competitor, Bitcoin; therefore we will start by learning what blockchains are, and what they offer. Once we understand this, we’ll cover the main problems behind the world’s first blockchain, Bitcoin, and how Peercoin has fixed these flaws.

You will discover that Sunny King, Peercoin’s original creator, had incredible foresight into the future of proof-of-work networks, and how Peercoin has been designed as a drop-in replacement in preparation for their inevitable decline.
