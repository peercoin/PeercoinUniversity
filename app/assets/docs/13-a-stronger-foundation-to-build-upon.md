# 13. A Stronger Foundation to Build Upon

Attack surface is an important concept to grasp when it comes to blockchain security. The more you add to and modify a system, the more complex it becomes. And as a system becomes more complex, there is a higher chance that something can go wrong or fail. In the short-term, a blockchain team that is constantly adding new features and rapidly advancing the protocol may seem exciting and innovative, however in the long run they are likely creating new bugs and vulnerabilities that will inevitably come to light.

The Peercoin development team believes in modularity. This means that Peercoin as the base layer should remain fairly unchanging. New protocol developments are debated at length by team members and are slow to be implemented in order to prevent fatal issues from occurring. New protocols and functionality such as tokens, smart contracts and high speed low cost transaction processing can then be added as independent layers.

Rather than developing these additional improved features and technologies directly into the blockchain protocol itself, instead they are built as separate layers that exist on top of the base layer blockchain. In the long run, this modularity will make Peercoin more secure and easier for developers to build upon.

This slow changing, ultra secure base layer blockchain is the ultimate foundation upon which any number of additional layers can be built. Anyone is free to build anything on top of Peercoin that is as risky or complex as they can conceive. And if their conception is flawed, Peercoin does not need to fall with it. The failure of any layers on top of Peercoin will have no impact on the base layer blockchain.

Overall, Peercoin’s primary purpose is to maximize decentralization in order to preserve a trustless network that can be relied upon now and in the future to secure all different types of value. The efficient and sustainable proof-of-stake technology provided by Peercoin offers developers a solid and decentralized foundation to build upon.
